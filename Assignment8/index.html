    <p>The first video has a relative path and you use the video tag. The video is located in the same folder as the html file, and the server knows where the document is. The second video has an absolute path and you use the iframe or inline frame tag. It is used to embed another HTML document into the current document. The video is linked to the file, and it is displayed by the browser. You need to include the protocol (http://) and the domain of the website.
